## Exploratory work on intermediate ligand generation for FEP.

See notebook for list of FEP ligand pairs. Env.yml can be used to create a conda environment that contains the dependencies (env is basically the same as the default dev biosimspace env, see https://biosimspace.org/install.html).

NOTE: adjusted LOMAP mcs.py in conda env to suppress INFO from logging.

Dependencies:

- rdkit
- matplotlib
- ipython/jupyter
- pandas
