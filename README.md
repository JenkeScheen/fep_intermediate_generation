## Exploratory work on intermediate ligand generation for FEP.

See notebook for list of FEP ligand pairs. Env.yml can be used to create a conda environment that contains the dependencies (doesn't work)(env is basically the same as the default dev biosimspace env, see https://biosimspace.org/install.html).



Dependencies:

- rdkit
- matplotlib
- ipython/jupyter
- pandas
- obabel (conda install -c conda-forge openbabel)
